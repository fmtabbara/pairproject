## Workflow

Once you have an issue to work on 

1. Take note of the issue number
2. Create a new branch off of the development branch and use the following naming convention
  
  `<new | bug | update>-<issue-number>-<name of branch>`
  
  for example an issue to create a new server file with an issue number of 10 would mean you should create a branch called, something like
  new-10-server-file
  
3. Pull the branch locally and do you work
4. Once you are ready and you have commited all your changes, push your changes up.
5. Create a PR to merge your branch into development
6. Once you PR is approved, merge your branch into the development branch and then delete your branch.
